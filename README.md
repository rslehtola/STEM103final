Project: Final: Misinformation Trivia game

# Project Description
Within this program is a beautiful trivia game. The questions for this game are completely based on stupid comments and statemnets made by Donald Trump from which are inaccurate or untrue. However, these questions and answers are true. Once ran, this program will welcome the user to the game and prompt them to input their name. Once they input their name and hit enter it will greet them by name and ask them to play a game and load the first question of twenty-four with a multiple choice answer. The user only needs to input a number between 1-4 and hit enter. If the user has answered the question incorrectly, it will display such and tell them what the correct answer was and prompt them to hit enter to continue to the next question. If the user answers the question correctly it will display a congradulation and prompt them to hit enter when they're ready to continue to the next question. If the user doesn't answer with a number between 1-4 it'll dispaly that it's not a valid number and ask them to please enter a 1, 2, 3, or 4. Once all twenty-four questions are answered it displays your final score and shows good sportsmanship with a good game and displaying the users name. I've attempted to answer my questions with every symbol, character, letter, number and it won't accept any answer other than 1, 2, 3 or 4.
